# Progressive Analogy

Research codebase for modular experiments on progressive analogy generation (PAG, SAG, ToT, etc.)
using multiple teacher/student/judge LLM families (LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, Gemini, Qwen, ...).

Structure:
- `config/` – configs for datasets, models, methods, and experiments
- `src/` – main Python source code (core logic, methods, models, judges, pipelines, evaluation)
- `data/` – datasets, splits, and results
- `experiments/` – per-experiment folders and outputs
- `analysis/` – notebooks and scripts for error analysis & visualization
- `paper/` – figures, tables, and drafts for writing
